# Best Practices

## Commit Messages

Give Nessie commits a meaningful commit summary and message, like
`aggregate-financial-stuff 2020/12/24`, so people that look through the
history of the data can grasp what that commit changes and why it's there.

## Reviews

Before merging manually performed changes back, it is really helpful to
let someone else who is familiar with the topic, the changes applied in a
work-branch (aka "development branch"), review the changes.
