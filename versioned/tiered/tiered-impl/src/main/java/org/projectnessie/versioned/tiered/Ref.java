/**
 * Reference-consumer for branches + tags.
 * <p>
 * Tags are handled by calling {@link #tag()} and setting the following attributes:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #tag()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #id(Id)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #name(String)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Tag#commit(Id)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Branches must have the following attributes, other attributes are not allowed:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #branch()}</li>
 * <li>{@link #id(Id)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #name(String)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Branch#commits(Consumer)} receives a {@link BranchCommit} that must be used to
 * immediately execute the callbacks that represent the commit-log for the branch</li>
 * <li>{@link Branch#metadata(Id)}</li>
 * <li>{@link Branch#children(Stream)} containing {@link Id} elements</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <em>Branches</em>
 *
 * <p>The branch state is a current snapshot of the L1 state. It may also include some changes which define how we arrived here.
 *
 * <p>This is basically an L1 but the id of the data and the parent is unknown until we finalize all commits.
 *
 * <p>This contains a commit log of non-finalized commits including deltas. These can be used to build up history of recent
 * commits just in case the L1's associated with each were not saved.
 *
 * <p>The initial structure of the commit log is:</p>
 *
 * <pre>[{id: &lt;EMPTY_COMMIT_ID&gt;, parent: &lt;EMPTY_COMMIT_ID&gt;}]</pre>
 *
 * <p>If a lot of commits come in at the same moment, the log may temporarily be represented like this:
 * <pre>
 * [
 *   {id: &lt;l1Id&gt;, parent: &lt;parent_l1id&gt;}
 *   {id: &lt;randomid&gt;, saved:false, deltas: [
 *       {position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;},
 *       {position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;}
 *       ]
 *   }
 *   {id: &lt;randomid&gt;, saved:false, deltas: [{position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;}]}
 *   {id: &lt;randomid&gt;, saved:false, deltas: [
 *       {position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;},
 *       {position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;}
 *       ]
 *   }
 *   {id: &lt;randomid&gt;, saved:false, deltas: [{position:&lt;pos&gt;, oldId: &lt;oldL2Id&gt;, newId: &lt;newL2Id&gt;}]}
 * ]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the state shown above, several concurrent commmiters have written their branch commits to the branch
 * but have yet to clean up. In those cases, any one of the committers may clean up some or all of the
 * non-finalized commits (including commits that potentially happened after their own).
 *
 * <p>Each time a commit happens, the committer will do the following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The mutates the branch tree AND adds their change to the list of commits in the log.
 * <li>Save the tree state (and any other pending saves) based on the result of their mutations in step 1. (*)
 * <li>Remove all finalized commits from the log except the last one. Finalize the last one within the log. (*)
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>A commit is complete once step (1) above is completed. While steps 2 and 3 are typically also done by the same actor as step 1,
 * they may not be. In situations where that actor dies or is slow, other actors may "finalize" that commit. The commit <b>must</b>
 * be finalized before being exposed to outside consumers of the VersionStore.
 *
 * <p>The following things are always true about the commit log.
 * <ol>
 * <li>There must always be at least one finalized entry.
 * <li>The order of commits will always be &lt;finalized&gt;+&lt;unsaved&gt;*
 * (one or more saved followed by zero or more unsaved commits).
 * <li>The ids for all saved commits will exist in the L1 table.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Implementations must return a shared state ({@code this}) from its method.
 * </p>
 * <p>For efficient serialization (think: serializing a value to for example to JSON without
 * buffering data, some store implementations require a strict ordering and in turn a strict
 * sequence of method invocations.</p>
