Project Nessie is a system to provide Git like capability for Iceberg Tables, Delta Lake Tables, Hive Tables and Sql Views.

More information can be found at [projectnessie.org](https://projectnessie.org/).


## Using Nessie

You can quickly get started with Nessie by using our small, fast docker image.

```
docker pull projectnessie/nessie
docker run -p 19120:19120 projectnessie/nessie
```

Then install the Nessie CLI tool

```
pip install pynessie
```

From there, you can use one of our technology integrations such those for 

* [Spark](https://projectnessie.org/tools/spark/)
* [Hive](https://projectnessie.org/tools/hive/)

Have fun! We have a Google Group and a Slack channel we use for both developers and 
users. Check them out [here](https://projectnessie.org/develop/).


## Building and Developing Nessie

### Requirements

- JDK 11 or higher: JDK11 or higher is needed to build Nessie (artifacts are built 
  for Java 8)

### Installation

Clone this repository and run maven:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/projectnessie/nessie
cd nessie
./mvnw clean install
```

#### Delta Lake artifacts

Nessie required some minor changes to Delta for full support of branching and history. These changes are currently being integrated into the [mainline repo](https://github.com/delta-io/delta). Until these have been merged we have provided custom builds in [our fork](https://github.com/projectnessie/delta) which can be downloaded from a separate maven repository. 

### Distribution
To run:
1. configuration in `servers/quarkus-server/src/main/resources/application.properties`
2. execute `./mvnw quarkus:dev`
3. go to `http://localhost:19120`

### UI 
To run the ui (from `ui` directory):
1. If you are running in test ensure that `setupProxy.js` points to the correct api instance. This ensures we avoid CORS
issues in testing
2. `npm install` will install dependencies
3. `npm run start` to start the ui in development mode via node

To deploy the ui (from `ui` directory):
1. `npm install` will install dependencies
2. `npm build` will minify and collect the package for deployment in `build`
3. the `build` directory can be deployed to any static hosting environment or run locally as `serve -s build`

### Docker image

When running `mvn clean install` a docker image will be created at `projectnessie/nessie` which can be started 
with `docker run -p 19120:19120 projectnessie/nessie` and the relevant environment variables. Environment variables
are specified as per https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/configsources.asciidoc#default-configsources  


### AWS Lambda
You can also deploy to AWS lambda function by following the steps in `servers/lambda/README.md`
